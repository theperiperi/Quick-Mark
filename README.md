# attendance-system-based-on-qr-and-face-recog
an end to end project where our application takes the photos from file(classroom) as input and puts desired faces in a pickle file and auto-generates qr codes for those faces in another file(qr_codes). when we run the attendance module, if a pickled face and their corresponding qr code are put in frame, then attendance is marked. marked attendance can be stored in a database for maintenance.
