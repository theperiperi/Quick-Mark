# attendance-system-based-on-qr-and-face-recog
our project showcases effective and quick maintenance of attendance (marking+storing). To make our model foolproof we use additional features like unique student qr code along with simultaneous face recognition. our model requires a reference image of each student to be put into a file. these images are then pickled and put into a .pckl file (this can be done with python file labelled pickling.py, it is a single time process, no need to do this each time you mark attendance). once the .pckl file is set up when main.py is run camera pop up appears and qr codes for each unique student become active. If a student whose picture is in database along with his/her qr code is in frame, attendance is marked. for easy access, you can view a print statement indicating who has marked attendance, this data is stored in an autogenerated database attendance.db for future reference of complete data
